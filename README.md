# KuiklyBase-platform

## Introduction
KuiklyBase is developed and open - sourced by the Oteam of Tencent's large front - end. Tencent Video and the PCG Device-side technology team were deeply involved in its construction. The `platform` module in this project adapts existing components for the HarmonyOS platform and optimizes the performance of certain features, helping developers improve development efficiency. It currently covers 10 foundational components. More components will be gradually open-sourced in the future to continuously enhance the technical ecosystem.
